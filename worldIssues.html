                    <p>
                        In rural and underserved areas, STEM education faces significant challenges due to limited access to resources. This includes inadequate 
                        technology, unreliable internet connectivity, and a shortage of updated learning materials. These obstacles hinder students' ability 
                        to engage fully in STEM subjects, ultimately impacting their future opportunities. Quantum Lane Softworks recognizes these issues 
                        and is committed to addressing them by providing technology solutions, supporting schools with necessary equipment, and offering 
                        educational software. To further combat this issue, Quantum Lane Softworks plans to collaborate with Elon Musk, leveraging his 
                        expertise and resources to bring <a href="https://medium.com/@parami.vishal/teslas-cutting-edge-technologies-pioneering-the-future-of-transportation-and-energy-cba6d8eee93b" target="_blank">cutting-edge</a>

                        <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1269639">Rachel S. Harris'</a>(2018), thesis addresses STEM education challenges in rural schools due to limited resources, inadequate funding, unqualified 
                        teachers, and cultural barriers. As a Georgia Southern University professor, Harris emphasizes the need to improve STEM education 
                        to meet global demands. Harris (2018), highlights the importance of STEM for economic growth, innovation, and job market preparation. 
                        Harris points out that outdated technology and insufficient STEM materials, along with less funding compared to urban and suburban 
                        schools, hinder STEM education in rural areas. Harris (2018), also discusses the difficulty in attracting qualified teachers due to lower 
                        salaries and fewer incentives. Cultural factors, such as lower expectations and support influenced by parents' educational 
                        backgrounds, further impede progress. Harris concludes that making STEM education relevant to local contexts can engage and support 
                        students and parents, stressing the urgency of resolving these issues to remain globally competitive and ensure equal education for 
                        all students.

                        emphasizes the urgent need for improved STEM education in rural America to remain globally competitive. Rural students 
                        face significant challenges like a lack of STEM resources and limited internet access. Lucas advocates for the Rural STEM 
                        Education Act to enhance teacher resources, hands-on learning, and broadband access.
