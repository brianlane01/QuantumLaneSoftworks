                    <h2>STEM EDUCATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        STEM education globally faces several significant challenges, including limited access to quality resources and trained 
                        educators, especially in rural and underserved areas. There is often a lack of funding and infrastructure to support 
                        advanced science and technology programs. Additionally, socio-economic disparities contribute to unequal opportunities, 
                        with students from disadvantaged backgrounds having less exposure to STEM fields. Gender and cultural biases further exacerbate 
                        these issues, discouraging participation from girls and minority groups. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancements 
                        requires continuous curriculum updates, which many education systems struggle to keep up with, resulting in outdated teaching methods 
                        and materials.

                        Rob Stephenson, a National Teacher of the Year Finalist, shares his methods 
                        for incorporating STEM education into his third grade classroom. He emphasizes the 
                        importance of making STEM a core part of every child’s learning experience, not just
                        at school, but also at home and within the community. By integrating STEM challenges into daily learning, 
                        Stephenson believes children will be better prepared for future success.

                        <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1269639">Rachel S. Harris'</a> thesis addresses STEM education challenges in rural schools due to limited resources, inadequate funding, unqualified 
                        teachers, and cultural barriers. As a Georgia Southern University professor, Harris emphasizes the need to improve STEM education 
                        to meet global demands. Harris highlights the importance of STEM for economic growth, innovation, and job market preparation. 
                        Harris points out that outdated technology and insufficient STEM materials, along with less funding compared to urban and suburban 
                        schools, hinder STEM education in rural areas. Harris also discusses the difficulty in attracting qualified teachers due to lower 
                        salaries and fewer incentives. Cultural factors, such as lower expectations and support influenced by parents' educational 
                        backgrounds, further impede progress. Harris concludes that making STEM education relevant to local contexts can engage and support 
                        students and parents, stressing the urgency of resolving these issues to remain globally competitive and ensure equal education for 
                        all students.

                        <a href="https://doi-org.proxyse.uits.iu.edu/10.1186/s40594-018-0151-2">Kelly C. Margot</a> thesis argues that despite the importance of STEM education, teachers face numerous challenges such as pedagogical, 
                        curriculum, structural, student-related, and assessment issues. Margot’s goal is to emphasize the necessity of effective STEM 
                        education for preparing students for the growing demand for STEM-literate workers. Margot, a professor at Grand Valley State 
                        University with a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology, notes the shortage of individuals in the STEM job market and stresses the 
                        importance of overcoming these challenges. Margot identifies significant barriers, including pedagogical and curricular challenges, 
                        structural limitations, student capability concerns, and insufficient support and assessment tools. Margot suggests improvements 
                        like collaborative opportunities, enhanced curriculum, district support, and professional development. Margot concludes by 
                        highlighting the need for comprehensive professional development and systemic support to boost teachers' ability to deliver STEM 
                        education.

                        <a href="#full-article">Jeremi S. London's</a> thesis states that systemic barriers, including racism, classism, and limited STEM education access, 
                        are hindering Black children's participation and success in STEM. As a Virginia Tech Engineering Education professor, 
                        London aims to help educators and researchers address these barriers for an inclusive STEM workforce. London’s review of 
                        41 articles identifies socioeconomic factors, education quality, community contexts, and local support as key issues. London 
                        argues that systemic racism and classism limit Black children's STEM access and that social perceptions and limited activities 
                        in Black communities dampen interest. London emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching and family support in 
                        fostering STEM aspirations. London concludes that early STEM programming, relevant pedagogy, teacher development, and community 
                        engagement are crucial for enhancing Black Americans' role in engineering.
