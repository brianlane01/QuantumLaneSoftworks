                    Quantum Lane Softworks recognizes that a crucial issue in the education system is that
                    current math and science curricula often alienate students from these essential disciplines 
                    rather than engage them. STEM advocate Amara Berry, drawing on her family’s scientific background,
                    underscores the urgent need to make STEM education more accessible and effective. This video demonstrates Quantum Lane Softworks’
                    commitment to transforming STEM education to better inspire and equip
